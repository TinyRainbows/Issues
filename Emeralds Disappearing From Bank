I was playing Wynncraft, when I realised I needed some emeralds. I went into my bank only to discover that my 40 emerald blocks
where gone. I checked all of my classes, but it wasn't in my inventory either. I then converted some emeralds into a block on my 
warrior and put it in the bank, switched into my archer and checked, but it was not there. I went back to my warrior and it 
wasn't there. Please return my emerald blocks to me, it took ages to collect them all. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
